# 🧠 My Learning Portal  
A structured and interactive repository where I document my learnings in **Frontend (React), JavaScript, Node.js, and System Architecture**.  
This repo includes **notes, code snippets, demo apps, architecture diagrams**, and a **React-based learning portal UI** to navigate all topics easily.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is my personal engineering knowledge hub.  
It helps me:

- Document concepts clearly  
- Store useful code snippets  
- Build small demo apps to try ideas  
- Explore system architecture visually  
- Create an interactive frontend that acts as a learning portal  
- Track my progress over time  

---

## 🏠 Learning Portal (React App)
Inside the `src/` folder is a custom **React-based learning dashboard** that acts as the UI for exploring topics.

### The portal includes:
✔ Homepage with category cards  
✔ Topic lists for each category  
✔ Integrated markdown renderer for notes  
✔ Demo links for hands-on practice  
✔ Expandable as I learn new topics
